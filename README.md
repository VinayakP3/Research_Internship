# Research_Internship

## Steps Involved

1. Importing the required libraries and modules
2. Defining image transformations and loading the MNIST dataset
3. Defining the architecture of the LeNet-5 model
4. Training the model for a certain number of epochs
5. Evaluating the accuracy of the model on the test data
6. Applying GradCAM visualization to a chosen image
7. Pruning the model and fine-tuning it for a certain number of epochs
8. Evaluating the accuracy of the pruned and fine-tuned model on the test data
9. Displaying the original and pruned images with GradCAM visualization

## Usage

- Install the required libraries and dependencies
- Run the code and observe the training process, accuracy, and visualization results
